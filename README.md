 List technologies used
Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Authentication and Game APIs
- SCSS

 Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.

 The Tic Tac Toe application planning process started with a SPA responsive site optimized for all display sizes.
 Wireframing included two pages, but quickly changed to one page with login details on the same page as the game itself.
 The game-board was designed with bootstrap for simplicity when resizing
 jQuery event listeners were placed on each box to listen for user clicks, and then set off a chain of functions depending on what the game player clicked.

 v2.0 fixes would include the application actually working properly, such as message updates after every action, showing game over/winner messages and CSS styling updates.

User Stories:
-- As a user, I want them to feel the game does not require detailed instructions
-- As a software engineer, I want users to feel impressed by the modern tools used
-- As a software engineer, I want this game to reliably work without crashing
-- As a product owner, I want to be confident to answer questions about why I chose to build
