Project title: Tic Tac Toe Dave

Techologies Used:
JavaScript
jQuery
Bootstrap
Authentication and Game APIs
SCSS

The Tic Tac Toe application planning process started with a SPA responsive site optimized for all display sizes. Wireframing included two pages, but quickly changed to one page with login details on the same page as the game itself. The game-board was designed with bootstrap for simplicity when resizing jQuery event listeners were placed on each box to listen for user clicks, and then set off a chain of functions depending on what the game player clicked.

User Stories:
-- As a user, I want them to feel the game does not require detailed instructions
-- As a software engineer, I want users to feel impressed by the modern tools used
-- As a software engineer, I want this game to reliably work without crashing
-- As a product owner, I want to be confident to answer questions about why I chose to build

v2.0 fixes would include the application actually working properly, such as message updates after every action, showing game over/winner messages and CSS styling updates.
